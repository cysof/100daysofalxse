#Print a string that spans multiple lines with whitespace preserved

print("""means that running print(paragraph) would display the string on mul-
tiple lines, just as it appears in the string literal. This may or may not
be what you want, so youâ€™ll need to think about the desired output
before you choose how to write a multiline string.""")
